To show your current understanding of Python, you will upload a code from scratch.

Your code must:

Import the Turtle Library
Create a turtle
Change the color or shape of the turtle
Use a for loop to repetitively draw a shape of your choosing.
Do not have the program draw the shape on top of itself.  Move the turtle before drawing another shape.
The shape must be repeated a number of times indicated by the user.
(Use the Input function)
These are the minimum requirements.  Here are some ideas to expand your code, but don't feel limited to them.

Allow the user to choose the color or shape of the turtle.
Allow the user to choose the shape that the turtle draws
Draw multiple different shapes
